            <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
            <p>
                DAW belongs to the subset of fully on-chain games, characterized
                by being entirely on-chain, open-ended, and having no pre-set
                gameplay.
            </p>
            <p>
                DAW is in the early stages of its development, and OPcraft
                stands out as one of its significant milestones.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary technological bottleneck lies in on-chain game
                engines. Currently, there are four prominent DAW game engines:
                MUD, Dojo, World Engine, and Keystone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Major Challenges facing DAW Development include the absence of
                standardized game development frameworks, difficulties in code
                reusability, and a shortage of data composability.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the upcoming bullish market cycle, a surge of popular
                applications is poised to emerge, capitalizing on the unique
                attributes of blockchain technology. Both SocialFi and GameFi
                exhibit promising potential.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What is DAW?</strong></p>
            <p>
                DAW (Decentralized Autonomous Worlds) belongs to the subset of
                fully on-chain games, characterized by being entirely on-chain,
                open-ended, and having no pre-set gameplay. By providing
                publicly accessible programmable interfaces, DAW empowers
                players to freely create, enhance, and expand their gaming
                experiences within the realm of this digital-physical reality,
                thereby extending the boundaries of the game's narrative.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the domain of Web2 gaming, there are two primary
                categories: Web2 non-autonomous world games and Web2 Autonomous
                World games (CAW). Web2 non-autonomous world games include
                popular titles like "Honor of Kings" and "League of Legends",
                which feature structured in-game objectives, such as "rankings".
                A prime example of CAW is "Minecraft." In this game, players are
                not constrained by a predefined ultimate game goal. It
                encourages creative freedom, opening up diverse gameplay
                possibilities. Within the Minecraft universe, players can do
                more than simply construct structures and manage virtual
                animals. They can explore advanced gameplay modes, including
                "survival mode," "adventure mode," "multiplayer" mode, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary distinction between Web3's DAW and Web2's CAW lies
                in the degree of decentralization. DAW stores every aspect of
                the game, including game assets, all elements related to
                gameplay, and the game's logic, on a blockchain network. In
                comparison to other fully on-chain games, DAW offers a richer
                array of features and gameplay, granting players greater
                autonomy within this decentralized world and enhancing the
                overall level of playability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: "Digital-physical reality" refers to the fundamental laws
                and systems that exist within a computational world. Each world
                in this context has its own set of governing rules, which
                determine all occurrences within it. These rules define the
                physics of that specific world. Moreover, in this context,
                "physics" is a term that encompasses the fundamental laws and
                systems present in any "world".
            </p>
            <p><strong>Milestones in DAW's Development</strong></p>
            <p>
                DAW is in the early stages of its development, and OPcraft
                stands out as one of its significant milestones.
            </p>
            <p>
                In October 2022, the Lattice team launched OPcraft, a fully
                on-chain 3D game inspired by Minecraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                OPCraft has established a set of simple game rules. Players can
                perform only four in-game actions: block destruction, block
                synthesis, block placement, and claiming a 16 x 16 land area
                (becoming the largest diamond pledger of that block).
                Furthermore, players can customize the frontend using the
                officially provided open plugin system to deploy custom
                components and systems. Within just two weeks of its launch,
                OPCraft attracted over 1,500 players, producing more than 3.5
                million on-chain records. It has also sparked various
                user-generated pixel art, player-made plugins, and a series of
                spontaneously formed competitions, games, and collective
                governance activities, including both malicious and friendly
                player behaviors.
            </p>
            <p>
                On October 29th, just two days before the conclusion of the
                OPcraft testing phase, a player named SupremeLeaderOP made an
                announcement on Discord and Twitter, declaring the establishment
                of a world government within the game. According to the OPcraft
                game settings, players could stake their diamonds to claim land.
                As per the official announcement, SupremeLeaderOP staked 135,200
                diamonds to establish ownership over a significant portion of
                the area around the spawn, effectively preventing others from
                building or mining on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In DAW games, boundless possibilities unfold, where events occur
                and evolve beyond anyone's control. This unparalleled freedom
                unleashes captivating gameplay experiences. DAW represents a
                significant gameplay advancement compared to early GameFi models
                that primarily focused on "Play to Earn" mechanics. It also
                competes alongside Web2 games in many aspects. Since OPcraft
                debut, a wave of DAW games has emerged, featuring notable titles
                like the Loot Realms series, ISAAC, and Topology.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Underlying Technical Principles of DAW</strong></p>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional off-chain games or hybrid on-chain/off-chain
                games, every action, transaction, and progression in on-chain
                games is recorded on the blockchain. This fundamental
                distinction sets them apart from Web2 games and represents a
                revolutionary game-changing paradigm. In DAW games, players have
                true ownership of their in-game assets, which can be traded,
                sold, or used as NFTs across various games. The game rules and
                mechanics are transparent and verifiable, enabling third-party
                developers to create unique experiences on top of the core game.
                Assets and progress can be seamlessly utilized across multiple
                games and platforms. Players can engage in the "Play to Earn"
                model, and these games are no longer under the control of a
                single entity. With the advancement of Layer 2 solutions,
                blockchain performance has made significant progress. However,
                when it comes to implementing the features mentioned above, the
                primary technological bottleneck lies in on-chain game engines,
                which differ from those used in Web2 games.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game engine is essentially a modularized code library and a
                set of tools. By utilizing the engine's various interfaces, game
                developers can accomplish tasks such as graphics rendering,
                physics simulation, and network communication without delving
                into low-level programming. This significantly saves time and
                allows developers to focus on game design and content creation.
                In the realm of commercial game engines, Unity and Unreal are
                the most commonly used options. On the other hand, on-chain game
                engines prioritize areas such as state synchronization, game
                security, enhancing gas cost efficiency, and ensuring maximum
                composability and interoperability. Currently, there are four
                prominent DAW game engines: MUD, Dojo, World Engine, and
                Keystone.
            </p>
            <p>
                MUD, developed by the Lattice team, is an open-source framework
                designed for creating on-chain apps. It has found extensive use
                not only in the gaming sector but also in various other fields.
                Many of the most popular on-chain games, such as OPCraft,
                Skystrife, Kamigotchi, and more, are built using the MUD
                framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dojo: Dojo is a Cairo-based on-chain game engine and technology
                stack optimized for autonomous world games on Starknet. Cairo is
                a Rust-like smart contract language that empowers developers to
                create verifiable applications, fully leveraging the scalability
                provided by Starknet. By using Cairo, Dojo enables Starknet's
                game developers to provide complexity and transparency in their
                games. Noteworthy games developed with Dojo include "Roll Your
                Own" and "Influence".
            </p>
            <p>
                World Engine: World Engine, developed by Argus, is designed to
                be a sharded rollup technology stack specifically created to
                support and enhance on-chain games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keystone: Keystone, developed by the Curio team, is a rollup
                framework constructed on the OP stack. Its primary aim is to
                empower high-performance on-chain games, with a particular focus
                on real-time strategy games like "Age of Empires". Keystone is
                designed to support multiple Data Availability (DA) layers,
                beginning with Celestia. Prominent games built on Keystone
                include "Treaty" and others.
            </p>
            <p>DAW's Dilemma and Future Prospects</p>
            <p>
                During the early stages of GameFi, these games often suffered
                relatively poor gameplay, with users primarily driven by the
                "Play To Earn" aspect. However, as game tokens were heavily
                mined and their value declined, this resulted in a significant
                decrease in the player base, creating a vicious cycle that
                challenged the sustainability of GameFi projects. Therefore, DAW
                games must prioritize enhancing gameplay and establishing a
                stable in-game economic cycle. They also need to introduce
                diversified and sustainable resources through external business
                expansion to ensure the game's longevity. In addition, from a
                technical standpoint, to truly achieve DAW, several core issues
                in the on-chain games must be tackled:
            </p>

                1. Absence of Game Development Frameworks: Many development
                teams often resort to a do-it-yourself approach, which results
                in inefficiencies. This approach hinders them from fully
                capitalizing on shared system knowledge to tackle common issues
                and fails to seize the opportunity for continuous optimization
                of the best solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Challenges with Code Reusability: Examining many of the
                currently developed blockchain games, it becomes evident that
                only a small portion of game code is reusable for creating
                different games. The lack of clear differentiation between
                layers and components across various games restricts the ability
                to employ shared code libraries for developing the next
                generation of games.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Lack of data composability: The challenge of sharing
                blockchain state between different blockchain games remains
                unresolved. Finding effective solutions for managing
                interoperability and data sharing among different blockchain
                games continues to be an ongoing problem.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
            <p>
                With the advancement of Layer 2 solutions, such as Op and
                Starknet, remarkable performance has been demonstrated,
                effectively mitigating the technological bottlenecks that had
                previously hindered blockchain progress. In the upcoming bullish
                market cycle, a surge of popular applications is poised to
                emerge, capitalizing on the unique attributes of blockchain
                technology. Alongside the recent surge in SocialFi's popularity,
                GameFi is also emerging as a highly promising sector. The rise
                of OPCraft has catapulted the DAW sector into the spotlight, and
                as game engines continue to advance, Web3 games are ready to
                compete with Web2 games, propelling the blockchain industry into
                traditional markets.
