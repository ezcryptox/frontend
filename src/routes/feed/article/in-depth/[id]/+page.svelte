        <p><strong>Background Behind GoMining's Emergence</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            According to statistics from CoinWarz, as the demand for Bitcoin
            continues to rise, the difficulty of bitcoin mining has reached a
            historic high. The bitcoin mining market is becoming increasingly
            competitive, leaving little room for smaller players. The landscape
            is now dominated by so-called "whales," that is, large pools and
            mining companies racing to capitalize on the next block.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Most mining operations now take place in warehouses or mining farms,
            not on home computers or laptops. Large mining farms equipped with
            specialized ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits)
            dominate the network. These ASICs are 100,000 times more efficient
            than CPUs. In the current cryptocurrency environment, large-scale
            operations are squeezing out individual miners.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Today, we will delve into GoMining, a bitcoin mining platform
            dedicated to enabling smaller clients, including those new to the
            cryptocurrency market, to enter the mining sector. The native token
            of GoMining platform, GOMINING, has recently been listed on
            Poloniex.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Introduction to GoMining</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            GoMining is a global bitcoin mining company with over seven years of
            market experience, operating nine top-notch data centers
            strategically located around the globe. Seeking a sustainable
            solution to re-engage individual miners and crypto enthusiasts,
            GoMining introduced the Liquid Bitcoin Hashrate (LBH) protocol, an
            innovation that democratizes cryptocurrency investments, providing
            users with the opportunity to mine Bitcoin without the complexities
            of traditional methods. The LBH vision is built upon the idea of
            assigning shares of bitcoin mining power to NFTs (also called
            digital miners), thus helping their holders to avoid the intricacies
            associated with running physical mining equipment. Simply put, the
            real bitcoin mining capability is linked to virtual miners, which
            exist as NFTs. To date, GoMining has attracted over 69,000 unique
            holders with over 141,000 total NFTs sold, successfully reducing
            entry costs for miners and speeding up the onboarding process.

        <p><strong>How to Mine Bitcoin With NFTs</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Bitcoin (BTC) mining involves solving complex and energy-intensive
            computational tasks to generate the next block on the blockchain.
            The first entity to successfully complete this task receives a
            Bitcoin reward, as defined by the blockchain's rules.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            As mentioned earlier, large mining pools are critical in possessing
            and overseeing vast computational power from expensive mining
            equipment. The challenges facing retail miners trying to join this
            battle go well beyond the significant investment needed to establish
            an efficient bitcoin mining operation. Considering the immense
            electricity consumption and the urgent need for skilled
            infrastructure maintenance, it is nearly impossible for individuals
            to undertake this task alone.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            GoMining has significantly redefined BTC mining accessibility by
            offering smaller players a chance to enter the market. With their
            Liquid Bitcoin Hashrate concept, the project aims to establish
            scalable synergies between infrastructure operators and individuals.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            The concept is both simple and ingenious. As noted above, GoMining
            links the computational power generated by its nine global data
            centers to NFTs (also known as NFT miners). These NFT miners enable
            users to participate in the mining process without the need to build
            and maintain their own mining infrastructure. Instead, they ensure
            stable and sustainable ownership of a fixed share of bitcoin mining
            rights, measured in terahashes.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Introduction to Digital Miners</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            GoMining NFTs, also known as digital miners, are characterized by
            two key parameters: computational power (measured in terahash per
            second, TH/s) and energy efficiency (expressed in watts per
            terahash, W/TH). These parameters directly determine the NFT's
            mining potential and its owner's rewards. To enhance efficiency,
            GoMining offers the lowest electricity prices for miners to mine BTC
            efficiently.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            To engage users in NFT bitcoin mining, GoMining allows enthusiasts
            to directly purchase digital miners on the platform or through
            popular centralized or decentralized exchanges. The starting price
            for GoMining NFTs is as low as $22 (which may vary slightly due to
            exchange rate fluctuations), with multiple payment methods
            available, such as USDT, BTC, the native GOMINING token, or fiat
            currency, thereby providing accessibility and convenience for a
            global audience.
        </p>

            <strong>Purchasing &amp; Upgrading NFT Miner Efficiency</strong>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            To start mining Bitcoin, users can choose to buy their first NFT
            miner or opt for a free trial period (up to 15 days) before making a
            final decision about the purchase.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Once the digital miner is purchased, users are free to customize it
            by upgrading computational power levels from 1 to 5,000 TH/s,
            creating a unique digital asset. Mining rewards are distributed
            daily based on the computational power held by each owner. As noted
            earlier, every GoMining NFT has two main characteristics:
            computational power (measured in terahashes per second or TH/s) and
            energy efficiency (watts per terahash or W/TH). Both of these
            parameters are available for upgrade.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            The additional computing power and higher energy efficiency levels
            can easily be purchased with just a few clicks. A user-friendly
            bitcoin mining calculator is readily available to help you visually
            assess the feasibility of upgrades. While electricity costs, which
            are covered daily, can be settled in BTC or GOMINING tokens with an
            additional 10% discount.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <p><strong>Mining Strategies &amp; Payback Period</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Solo Mining</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            The GoMining platform offers two main profit strategies: Solo and
            Pool mining. In Solo mining, rewards are guaranteed to be
            distributed proportionally based on the total computational power of
            all users' digital miners, providing GoMining with a stable and
            predictable way of earning daily rewards.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            NFT holders simply need to simply hang on to their digital miners
            and cover the electricity fees to mine Bitcoin easily every day. The
            average expected payback period for Solo mining is about 12-18
            months, which, although not supersonic, is far less risky compared
            to direct investments in altcoins or BTC. Importantly, GoMining
            users fully own their NFTs and associated hashrate, whereas Bitcoin
            cloud mining projects are usually based on the rented mining
            capacities of third parties.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Notably, the company's digital miners can easily be sold on the
            secondary market, ensuring that any purchased mining power remains a
            liquid asset, and allowing users to sell it on their own terms,
            tailor their strategies, or adapt to changing plans.

        <p>
            Participants can join forces with other miners, pooling their
            computational power to increase earnings. Users can also establish
            their own mining pools to further strengthen the mining community.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            For those who want to get a hands-on understanding of how bitcoin
            mining works, Pool mining is the perfect choice. It offers the
            opportunity to band together with other participants by entering a
            virtual mining pool or organizing one themselves. In this scenario,
            the team that successfully mines the block will receive more
            rewards, which are distributed to all pool participants based on
            their contributions in terms of computational power, provided their
            pool is successful, although the rewards are not guaranteed like in
            Solo mining mode.

        <p>
            GoMining appears firmly focused on the future, with a series of
            ambitious plans, such as constructing a 200-megawatt data center and
            planning to list on major exchanges by the end of the year. With
            over 99% uptime of mining equipment, a current hashrate of 2,847,077
            TH/s, and a power capacity of 350 MW at GoMining data centers, its
            credibility is further enhanced, making its robust infrastructure
            and outstanding operations stand out from the competition.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            The project is not content with the status quo, having mapped out a
            roadmap of targeted, significant increases in hashing power — the
            goal being to raise the project's hashing power to 5,000,000 TH/s in
            the first half of 2024, to 10,000,000 TH/s in the second half of the
            year, and to 25,000,000 TH/s by 2025. The GoMining team also plans
            to launch a brand-new mining pool and employ strategic measures such
            as enhancing mining equipment performance via artificial
            intelligence tools.

            GOMINING is the native token of the GoMining platform and plays a
            crucial role in the veGOMINING token model. Accessible on both the
            Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains, GOMINING can be used
            for discounted electricity payments, staking, and in-app payments,
            like digital miner purchases and upgrades.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            According to GoMining's unique deflationary-based token model, a
            portion of GOMINING's supply collected for electricity payments
            undergoes weekly burn and mint cycles. During these cycles, all
            collected tokens are burned and then minted back in a lesser amount.
            The amount of minted tokens is defined by the ratio of the ongoing
            epoch and cycle. Currently, the platform mints back 83% of the
            weekly collected amount.

        <p>GoMining Token Burn &amp; Mint Cycles</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            The burn and mint process aims to increase the asset's value by
            gradually decreasing the circulating supply. With an initial
            GOMINING supply of 436,915,240 tokens, the ecosystem is targeting a
            mid-term goal of reducing this to 100,000,000 tokens. According to
            platform statistics, approximately 350,000 tokens are currently paid
            for maintenance daily, equating to around $100,000 daily and $3
            million monthly directed to burning.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            The newly minted GOMINING tokens are distributed among service
            providers (65% of the newly generated supply), with the remaining
            portion allocated to GOMINING stakers, reward pools, and the team.
            Each burn and mint cycle eliminates a small portion of the initial
            supply, encouraging constant growth in the price of the token.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Another important factor driving GOMINING's price growth is the
            increasing number of NFT holders. The logic is simple: the more
            digital miners and terahashes owned, the greater the demand for
            GOMINING. Combined with a constantly decreasing token supply, this
            increasing demand is expected to push the token price up in the mid-
            and long-term.

        <p><strong> GOMINING Token Performance</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            GOMINING's price performance has been impressive, with an increase
            of 201% last year. It is currently in a phase of slow ascension
            after completing a base formation, making it a good time to buy.
